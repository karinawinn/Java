## Overview

**Project Title**: Learning Java: A Number Guessing Game

**Project Description**: I created a number guessing game where the player tries to guess the correct number between 0 and 100. After each guess incorrect guess, the player is told whether their guess is lower or higher than the correct number. If the player gets the correct number within 10 guesses, they win. 

**Project Goals**: To learn a new programming language (java) and how it's both similiar to and different from other programming languages. 

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download the files in the NumberGuess folder. 
2. Open and run the files in an appropriate IDE.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Open the appropriate java files in your chosen IDE.
2. Run the Main.java file.
3. Input appropriate responses when prompted.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Any IDE that has the capability of running java code (I used VS code).
* Have the appropriate extensions installed (Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat, Maven for Java, Project Manager for Java, Test Runner for Java, and Debugger for Java on VS Code).

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* W3 Schools has a bunch of pages on programming in java. This link goes to the Getting Started page, but from there you can navigate to lots of other pages. I mostly used the Java If...Else, Java While Loop, Java For Loop, and Java HashSet pages. [Java Getting Started](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_getstarted.asp) 
* [Java Interface Tutorial](https://youtu.be/Yat8l37XGFA)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add a GUI that's more user friendly.
